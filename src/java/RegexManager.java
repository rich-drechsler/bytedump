/*
 * This class was used to help convert the bash implementation of bytedump to a Java
 * version. My goal, when I eventually started working on the conversion was a Java
 * class (currently ByteDump) that resembled the bytedump bash script closely enough
 * that understanding one implementation would be useful if you decided to dig into
 * the other. Regular expressions pop up all over the place in the bash version of
 * bytedump and they're supported by both languages, but their capabilities and the
 * way they're typically used in programs can look very different. Trying to smooth
 * out some of the "structural" differences is why this class was built.
 *
 * Matching a string against a bash regular expression is an operation that returns
 * an integer that reflects what happened, and as a bonus, successful matches also
 * populate the BASH_REMATCH array with all of the matched subexpressions. It leads
 * to a style in the bash bytedump script where regular expressions are matched in
 * an if statement, the true branch handles a successful match, often using strings
 * stored in BASH_REMATCH, and the false branch is responsible for all unsuccessful
 * matches.
 *
 * Reproducing that "style" in the Java conversion would be useful, but didn't seem
 * possible without a new method or a new class, like this one, sitting between the
 * application and Java's Pattern and Matcher classes. In fact, a method that takes
 * at least two arguments (the target and regular expression strings) and returns a
 * String array filled with the matched groups on a successful match, or null if the
 * match fails, probably could (in a single method call) replicate what happens when
 * a bash script uses a regular expression.
 *
 * That would preserve the overall "structure" of the regular expression code used
 * in the two versions, but hiding Java's Pattern and Matcher classes from users is
 * an approach with consequences that this class has to address. Regular expressions
 * in Java are tiny little programs, written in a cryptic language that's encoded in
 * a Java string. Even though it's often hard to believe, the "language" that those
 * little programs are written in is primarily for people, not computers - regular
 * expression strings always have to be translated into a different format before
 * they can be efficiently used to match target strings.
 *
 * That translation is usually called compilation. It happens behind the scenes in
 * bash scripts, but in Java, applications are responsible for compiling a regular
 * expression, and it's done using one of the public compile() methods defined in
 * the Pattern class. Adopting bash's regular expression approach means that this
 * class (rather than ByteDump) will have to be responsible for the compilation of
 * regular expression strings that are passed as arguments to its public methods.
 *
 * If you're curious about what happens when regular expressions are compiled, take
 * a quick look at the source code for Java's Pattern class. It's available online
 * at
 *
 *     https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/regex/Pattern.java
 *
 * or in the src.zip file that's distributed with most (perhaps all) JDK releases.
 * Following all the compilation details isn't important, but convincing yourself
 * that it might not be a trivial operation is probably worth a quick look.
 *
 * Every regular expression in a Java program has to be compiled before it's used,
 * and as far as I know, calling Pattern.compile() (while the program is running)
 * at least once for each regular expression, is the only reasonable way to do it.
 * When it succeeds, the compiled regular expression is encapsulated in a Pattern
 * class that's returned to the caller. As long as we hang on to one reference to
 * that Pattern, we shouldn't have to recompile the regular expression when we're
 * asked to use it again.
 *
 * Once you have that compiled pattern, you use its matcher() method to create a
 * Matcher class instance that matches a CharSequence (which for our purposes is
 * always a String) against that compiled regular expression. A quick look at the
 * matcher() method definition in Java's Pattern.java class file should convince
 * you that it's not an expensive operation, particularly when compared to regular
 * expression compilation. With that in mind, I decided to keep things simple and
 * create a new Matcher instance (from an existing Pattern) whenever we need one.
 *
 * Hiding Java's Pattern and Matcher classes from an application, but doing it in
 * a way that gives the application some control over the recompilation of regular
 * expressions, means implementing a simple caching mechanism that can be used to
 * recover compiled Patterns. Caching really isn't expensive, so remembering every
 * successfully compiled regular expression would not be unreasonable. However, I
 * wanted applications to have the final say, so right now instance methods always
 * cache newly created Patterns, while static methods never do. The public instance
 * methods named
 *
 *     matched()
 *     matchedGroups()
 *     matchedGroup()
 *
 * and their static counterparts
 *
 *     getMatched()
 *     getMatchedGroups()
 *     getMatchedGroup()
 *
 * are the methods that were specifically designed for converting the bash bytedump
 * implementation to Java. Matcher classes created by any of those methods are never
 * saved.
 *
 * NOTE - in all methods that take the target string and regular expression string
 * as arguments, the target always preceeds the regular expression in the argument
 * list. It's the order they "appear" in bash regular expressions and that's really
 * why I picked it.
 *
 * NOTE - my guess is this file, Terminator.java, and maybe StringTo.java are the
 * only class files that might be useful in completely unrelated Java applications.
 * Feel free to grab them if you want. Terminator.java and StringTo.java currently
 * use this class, but removing that dependence would not be difficult.
 *
 * NOTE - in Java source files I only use block style comments, like the one you're
 * reading right now, outside class definitions, because that means they're usually
 * available for temporarily commenting out one or more lines of Java code.
