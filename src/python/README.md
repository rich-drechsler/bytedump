## Bytedump - Python Version

This implementation was generated entirely by Gemini 3.0 Pro, essentially with no
input from me except for the initial instructions that have been included in this
directory. My occasional interactions with various chatbots prior to Gemini 3 Pro
led me to conclude that none of them would be able to handle the translation from
the Java (and Bash) versions to a working Python program. I was, to say the least,
pleasantly surprised this time.

I haven't run extensive tests yet, but the dumps that I tried generated the output
that I expected. The documentation available in the other versions is missing, but
it will be added. I also plan on going through the Python code and adding comments
and perhaps reorganizing things in the near future, undoubtedly with Gemini's help.
For now just keep in mind that this version was generated in a chat that probably
lasted 90 mins and most of that time can be attributed to my lack of attention once
I decided to just let Gemini build whatever it wanted.
