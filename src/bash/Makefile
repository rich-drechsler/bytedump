## A makefile for the bash implementation of the bytedump program that was written
## for GNU make. Take a look at
##
##     https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html
##
## if you want more information about GNU make. It's a big manual, and in the past
## I would occasionally use it as a reference, but today chatbots are the place to
## go for help with GNU make.
##
## A common complaint about makefiles is tab indentation that's required in recipes.
## I often use vim, and by default my .vimrc file tells vim to automatically expand
## tabs. That would break most makefiles, so I also include the line
##
##     autocmd FileType make setlocal noexpandtab
##
## in .vimrc to prevent tab expansion when vim decides I'm editing a makefile. You
## may have to deal with something similar whenever you edit makefiles.

# Overview
#
####################

#
# This makefile manages the bash version of bytedump. It understands the following
# targets, which currently work in every makefile in this repository:
#
#         all - builds the bash version of bytedump, but leaves everything in
#               this directory. The executable is named bytedump-bash and it
#               should run if you point your shell at it.
#
#               This is the first target in the makefile that doesn't start with
#               a period, so it's also the target that's built when there aren't
#               any targets mentioned on the command line. In other words
#
#                   make all
#
#               and
#
#                   make
#
#               accomplish exactly the same thing.
#
#     install - builds the "all" target and then copies whatever's necessary to
#               the right place under the directory assigned to the INSTALLDIR
#               variable. That directory must exist, but any directories under
#               it, like bin or lib, will be created as needed.
#
#               Command line arguments that are handed to GNU make normally are
#               the targets that you want built, however an argument containing
#               an equal sign is treated as a variable assignment that overrides
#               any existing definition of that variable. For example,
#
#                   make INSTALLDIR=/tmp/bytedump install
#
#               will install everything in directory /tmp/bytedump, provided that
#               directory already exists.
#
#       clean - removes any files created by this makefile that aren't needed to
#               run this application.
#
#     clobber - removes all of the files created by this makefile, including the
#               ones needed to run this application.
#
#   testfiles - builds test files that might occasionally be useful.
#
#    validate - builds the "all" target and then checks the bash implementation of
#               bytedump using shellcheck.
